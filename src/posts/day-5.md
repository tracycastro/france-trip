Bonjour! Our big adventure for the day was a train trip to Versailles to visit the Château de Versailles, 12 miles west of Paris. Our tour guide took us through the gardens, the Hall of Mirrors, and the residence of King Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette until the French Revolution. Here are some photos:

We stayed in the city of Versaille for crepes are walked around a little bit. Here are some photos from the train and from our day:

A little outdoor market was set up between the train station and the palace.

For dinner we ate on the patio of Gino.

And on the way back to the hotel, the Seine looked especially beatuiful in the evening light. It stays light until around 10:30pm, which makes it easy to loose track of time and stay up later than normal.

Tomorrow is our last day in Paris. We are going to have a french cooking lesson and also do a little laundry before packing up for Bayeux in Normandy.
