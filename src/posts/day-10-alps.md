I'm a day behind posting this, but we've been pretty busy here in Annecy. Yesterday, Day 10, we rode a cable car from Chamonix to [Aguille du Midi](https://www.montblancnaturalresort.com/en/aiguille-du-midi) in the French Alps.

It was amazing to ride the cable car straight up the mountain, and the views were absolutely breathtaking. As you can see, I had a hard time narrowing down our photos to just a few:

After the cable car, we spent the afternoon exploring the town on Chamonix:

Our favorite stop was at [Église Notre-Dame de Toute Grâce du Plateau d'Assy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89glise_Notre-Dame_de_Toute_Gr%C3%A2ce_du_Plateau_d%27Assy), built between 1937-46.

Here's an excerpt from the brochure:

> Between 1926 and 1937, numerous sanatoriums were built on the Plateau d'Assy. Canon Jean Devémy, chaplain of the sanatorium of Sancellemoz, was given the task of building a church that would mark the revival of 20th century religious art. Following the advice of his friend, Marie Alain Couturier, a dominican priest who believed that "all true artists are inspired", Canon Devémy "put his faith in genius" and for the decoration of the church, he called upon the participation of the greatest modern artists, regardless of their personal religious beliefs or political tencancies.

> This is what we call **The Lesson of Assy**

Tomorrow, I hope to tell you about our day in Annecy while we ride the train to Avignon.
