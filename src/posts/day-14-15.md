Hello from Antibes, on the French Riviera (CÃ´te d'Azur) between Cannes and Nice. We are in the southeast of France, right on the Mediterranean coastline. The sky is extra blue here, and the sun is bright. It's humid and warm, kind of like Austin. We haven't had a lot of our schedule here in Antibes, just one quick guided tour, which is a nice way to wrap up the trip and start thinking about heading home. Here are some photos of the old town here, and of the yachting harbour and beach.
