Hi from Paris - we made it! We landed in Paris about 7:15 this morning (just after midnight in Texas). None of us got very much sleep on the plane, but the excitement over just being here has kept us energized all day. Mostly. I did nap for an hour this afternoon while Clarissa and Eli walked around la Marais district:

Here's Clarissa outside a bookstore they found:

Now, here are some photos from earlier in the day. There are so many more photos I would like to include but I don't want this post to go on too long.

We walked across Pont d'Austerlitz over the Seine to visit the [Jardin des Plantes](https://www.jardindesplantesdeparis.fr/en).

Here's the École de botanique (botanical school) at the Jardin de Plantes (garden of plants):

A [very sweet](https://www.instagram.com/crible.cafe/) coffee shop with a very kind barista, and good coffee to counteract the jetlag:
