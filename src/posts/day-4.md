Hello! Today we visited [the Louvre](https://www.louvre.fr/en), the famous art museum and former palace. With the help of a tour guide, we went from Greek antiquities all the way through to the apartments of Napoleon III - in four hours! I was too saturated to take in any more information by the end, but then again we didn't see even a fraction of the art here. So much art! We breezed past several works I remember from Art History.

I especially love the glass pyramid in the coutyard, designed by IM Pei in 1989. I was in high school when this opened, and even from Dallas I heard about the controversy of adding something so modern to a historical place.

This statue is called "Psyché ranimée par le baiser de l’Amour" (Psyche revived by Cupid's kiss).
It's one of my favorites.

The Venus de Milo(!)

"The Wedding at Cana" by Veronese. Apparently, Napoleon's army stole this from an Italian Monestary in 1787. Much [plundering and drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wedding_at_Cana#Plunder_and_repatriation)!

This is not a good photo of the Mona Lisa. Google will give you a much better image. But this is so we can remember that we were there in person once. Pretty cool!

We had lunch at this sweet restaurant. It's my favorite restaurant in France so far. I had a delicious salade. Even though Duolingo tells me I've been practicing French 220 days in a row, just ordering in restaurants in still pretty challenging. Ofter when I ask for something in French, the person I'm talking to replies in English. The server at this patisserie did not speak much English though, and also didn't understand my broken French very well. He asked if I wanted a pastry with grapefruit which sounded intriguing, so I said yes. But he brought a brioche bun with raisins. Ha ha! I guess raisins come from grapes, which could be confused with grapefruit? I thought it was pretty funny and even though I don't usually like raisins, my pastry was very delicious.

Here are some more photos from our sweet lunch:

We figured out the metro today, which was empowering and fun! Yay public transportation!

Tomorrow: Versailles!
