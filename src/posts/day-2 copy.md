Salut! We had a lot of fun on our tour of the Eiffel Tower. I think the best part was the stunning views of Paris from every direction. Here are a few of my favorite photos:

The tall buildings here are the financial district (La D√©fense). Skyscrapers aren't allowed to be constructed in Paris, so this district is outside the beltway (The Boulevard P√©riph√©rique), the loop of highway that separates Paris proper from greater Paris.

Here is the Seine again!

While Eli and I were at the Eiffel tower, Clarissa visited the Pantheon. I'll let her tell you all about it but here are two photos she took.

I almost forgot to mention, but this morning, our first stop after breakfast (pain au chocolat! chausson pomme!) was the [Mus√©e d'Orsay](https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en). We saw so many beautiful Impressioist paintings we'd only seen in books.

Here are some children sketching a Renoir painting.

Here are a few photos just from walking around from one place to another:

A statue of Montaigne. Do you see his foot is shiny because so many people rub it as they walk by? It's supposed to be [good luck](https://frenchmoments.eu/statue-of-montaigne/).

I don't actually know much about these photos, just things we saw that seemed lovely:

Tomorrow, we're visiting the Louve!
