Hello! Salut! We are on our way. The last week has been a whirlwind of getting the dog and cats ready for the kennels, finding our passports and vaccine cards, arranging for a plant sitter, and many other little chores and errands. I can't believe our travel day is finally here.

Here we are on our plane to Minneapolis:

After our layover in Minneapolis, we will get on a 4:30pm flight to Paris, so it will already be 11:30pm in Paris when our flight takes off. We are hoping to sleep as much as possible during the 8Â½ hour flight. If all goes according to plan, we will land a little after 8am.

The advice for fighting jetlag is to avoid napping during the day, and to spend your time out walking in the fresh air and sunlight. So the plan is to drop our luggage off at the hotel and go find breakfast and do some exploring. I'm hoping for a croissant. Obviously. ðŸ˜‰ Hopefully we won't be too sleepy to enjoy ourselves!
