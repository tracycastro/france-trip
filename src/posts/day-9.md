Today we spent 11 hours getting from Bayeux, which is in the north of France (Normandy), to Annecy which is in the southeastern part of the country. Annecy is in the French Alps, only 22 miles from Geneva. By the time we got here, we were tired from our long day of travel, and ready to rest up for our big adventure tomorrow up to the mountain top at [Aguille du Midi](https://www.montblancnaturalresort.com/en/aiguille-du-midi).

Here is the train station in Bayeux around 7 this morning.

And here is the train that came to get us and take us to Paris:

That train dropped us off in one train station in Paris, where we had to carry all of our bags and find a taxi to another train station on the other side of the city. The second train was from Paris to Annecy. Here are some photos from the window of the train.
