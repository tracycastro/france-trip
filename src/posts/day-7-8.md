We’ve spent the last two days in Bayeux, a charming village about 6 miles inland from the Normandy beaches. You can see the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Bayeux from almost everywhere in the town, and we started our first day with a visit. The cathedral includes a crypt that was built back in the 11th century. The stained glass was breathtaking.

Here's the cathedral:

Our hotel (Hôtel Tardif | Maison d'hôtes & Appartements) is just a few steps away from the cathedral and we spent the afternoon learning about the history of the building we’re staying in. The Hotel Tardif was originally built in the early 1700s by a botanist who went on to plan the gardens at Versailles. It also served as a command post for allied forces the day after D-Day, when the town was the first in France to be liberated from the Nazis.

Bayeux is an amazing place just to be - we’ve visited [the famous tapestry](https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/) and the [Memorial Museum of the Battle of Normandy](https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/memorial-museum-battle-of-normandy/) but the most breathtaking moments were just walking around the town:
